Cloud Architecture Terminologies:
Solution Archtect: architects a technical solution using multiple systems via resesarching, documentation, experimentation
Cloud Architect: solution architect focusing solely on architecting technical solutions using cloud services
Important factors to consider when designing solution architect:
- availability: ensure a service remains available
- scalability: ability to grow rapidly
- elastcity: ability shrink/grow to meed the demand
- fault tolerance
- disaster recovery
Also business factors:
- Security: how secure is the solution
- Cost: how much is this going to cost

High Availability: running workload across multiple AZs -> use Elastic Load Balancer: evenly distribute traffic to multiple servers in 1 or more datacenter -> only route the traffic to available/healthy datacenter with servers

High scalability: increase capacity based on the increasing demand of traffic/memory/computing power
- vertical scaling: upgrade to bigger server
- horizontal scaling: add more servers of the same size -> also increase availablity -> better

High elasticity: ability to AUTOMATICALLY increase or DECREASE (automatic and can go both ways) your capacity based on the current demand
- Horizonal scaling: scaling out vs. scaliing in
- Vertical scaling is generally harder
- Done through Auto Scaling Groups (ASG): AWS feature that automatically add/remove servers based on scaling rules

Fault Tolerance: ensure there's no single point of failure
- fail-overs: a plan to shift traffic to a redundant system in case the primary system fails
- example: have a copy of your database where all ongoing changes are synced -> not in use until a fail over occurs -> becomes the primary database -> RDS Multi-AZ: run duplicate standby database in another AZ 

High Durability: ability to recover from a disaster and to prevent the loss of data
- do you have a backup
- how fast can you restore that backup
- does your backup still work
- how do you ensure current live data is not corrupt
-> cloudendure disaster recovery: continuously replicates your machines into a low-cost staging area in your target AWS account and preferred region -> enable fast, reliable recovery in case of IT data center failures.
