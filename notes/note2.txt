AWS Global Infrastructure Overview: globally distributed hardware and datacenters that are physically networked together to act as 1 large resource for the end user -> availability zones, direct connection locations, points of presence, local zone, wavelength zones

Regions: geographically distinct locaations, have 1+ availability zones, physically isolated from and independent of every other region  in terms of location, power, and water supply
- generally has 3 availability zones
- new services almost always become available first in us-east
- not all aws services are available in all regions
- all billing info appears in us-east-1
- cost of aws services vary per region
4 factos for choosing a region:
1. what regulatory compliance does this region meet?
2. what is the cost of aws services in this region?
3. what aws services are available in this region?
4. what is the distance or latency to my end users?

Regional vs. global services
regional service: dont explicitly set the region at the time of creation
global: 1. no concept of region e.g. iam user, a siingle region must be explicitly chose e.g. S3 bucket, or a group of regions are chose e.g. cloudfront distribution

Availability Zones AZ: 1+ datacenters
- datacenter: a secured building containing hundreds of thousands of computers
a region: 3+ AZs
- datacenters within regions: isolated from each other but will be close enough to provide low latency
- common practice to run workloads in at least 3 AZs to ensure service remain available in case of 1 or 2 datacenters fail
AZ: represented by a region code, followed by a letter identifier e.g. us-east-1a

A subnet: associated with an AZ -> never choose AZ when launching resources but choose a subnet which is associated with an AZ

Fault Tolerance:
- fault domain: a section of a network that is vulnerable to damage if a critical device/system fails -> if failure occurs, will not cascade outside that domain -> limiting the damage; can have fault domains nested inside fault domains
- fault level: a collection of fault domains
- examples of scope of a fault domain:
    + specific servers in a rack
    + an entire rack in a datacenter
    + an entire room in a datacenter
...
-> up to CSPs to define the boundaries of a domain
- Region: completely isolated from each other -> achieves the greatest possible fault tolerance and stability
- AZs: isolated but connected through low latency link:
    + AZs are physically separated within a a typical metropolitan region, located in lower risk flood plains
    + discrete uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and onsite backup generation facilities
    + data centers located in different AZs -> supplied by independent substations to reduce the risk of an even on the power grid impacting more than 1 AZ
    + AZ are all redundantly connected to multiple tier-1 transit providers

AWS Global Network: interconnections between AWS Global Infrastructure -> backbone of AWS -> can move very fast between datacenters -> Edge Locations: on and off ramps to the AWS Global Network
- AWS GLobal Accelerator: use Edge Locations as an on-ramp to quickly reach AWS resources in other regions
- Amazon CloudFront (CDN): off-ramp to provide a the Edge storage and compute near the end user
- VPC Endpoints: ensure your resources stay within the AWS network and do not traverse over the public internet

Point of Presence (PoP): and intermediary location between an AWS Region and the end user:
- for AWS: PoP is a data center owned by AWS or a trusted partner, utilized by AWS Services related to content delivery or expediated upload -> edge location, regional edge cache
    + edge locations: datacenters that hold cached on the most popular files s.t. the delivery of distance to the end users are reduced.
    + regional edge locations: datacenters that hold much larger caches of less-popular files to reduce a full round trip and cost of transfer fees.

Tier 1 network: network that can reach every other network on the internet without purchasing IP transit or paying for peering

AWS Services using PoPs:
- Amazon CloudFront:
    + point your website to CloudFront so that it will route requests to nearest Edge Location cache
    + allows you to choose an origin (e.g. a web server or storage) that will be the source of cache
    + caches the content of what origin would returned to various Edge Locations around the world.
- Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration: generate a special URL-> used to upload files to a nearby Edge Location-> can then be moved much faster within the AWS Network to reach S3
- AWS Global Accelerator: find the optimal path from the end user to your web servers:
    + deployed within Edge Locations
    + send user traffic to Edge Location insead of directly to your web application
    + good for when you have set up resources in a region but not in another -> quickly get service running in other region

AWS Direct Connect: private/dedicated connection between your datacenter/office/co-location and AWS
- 2 options: lower vs. higher bandwidth
- help reduce network costs and increase bandwidh throughput
- provide more consistent network experience (reliable and secure)
(co-location: a datacener where equipment, space, and bandwidth are available for rental to retail customers)

Direct Connect Locations: trusted partnered datacenters that you can establish a dedicated high speed, low latency connection from your on-premise to AWS -> use AWS Direct Connect service to order and establish a connection

AWS Local Zones: datacenters located very close to densely populated area to provide single-digit milisecond low latency performance for that area
- need to opt-in i.e. talk to AWS support or open a ticket
- tied to a specific region
- only specific AWS services have been made available
- Purposes: support highly-demanding applicaions sensitive to latencies e.g. media entertainment, machine learning ,...

Wavelength zone: allow for edge computing (computing done on site or near a particular data source) on 5G network -> ultra-low latency 
- subnet is tied to a WZ -> launch VMs to the edge of the targeted 5G Networks

Data Residency: the physical/geographic location of where an organization or cloud resources reside
- Compliance Boundaries: legal requirement describing where data/cloud resources are allowed to reside
- Data Sovereignty: legal authority that can be asserted over data because its physical location is within jurisdictional boundaried
- Control data residency by:
    + AWS Outposts (expensive): physical rack of servers put in your data center -> your data will reside whenever the Outpost physically resides
    + AWS Config: Policy as Code service -> create rules to continuous check AWS resources configuration -> alerted or auto-remediated when deviation
    + IAM Policies: can explicity deny access to specific AWS regions -> Service Control Policy (SCP): permissions applied organization wide

AWS for Government: need to meet regulatory compliance program -> special regions for US regulation: GovCloud:
- a CSP offering an isolated region to run FedRAMP workloads
- allow customers to host sensitive Controlled Unclassified Information and other types of regulated workload:
	+ only operated by US citizens, on US soil
	+ only accessible to US entities who pass a screening process
- can architect secure cloud solutions that comply with FedRAMP, DOJ security policy etc.

AWS in China: completely isolated intentionally from AWS Global to meet regulatory compliance in China
- on its own domain: amazonaws.cn
- need a Chinese business license to operate in AWS China region
- not all services are available
- will not have to traverse the Great Firewall 

Sustainability: 
1. renewablt energy: aim to have AWS Global Infrastructure powered by 100% renewable energy by 2025
2. cloud efficiency: 3.6 times more energy efficient than the median of US enterprise datacenters surveyed
3. Water stewardship: use of recycled water, on-site water treatment, etc.

AWS Ground Station: a fully managed service that lets you control satellite communications, process data, scale operation without building/managing your own ground station infrastructure
- use case: weather forecasting, surface imaging, communication, video broadcast
- to use ground station:
	+ schedule a contact (select a satellite, start/end time, ground location)
	+ use AWS Ground Station EC2 AMI to launch EC2 instance that will uplink and downlink data during the contact or receive downlinked data in an Amazon S3 bucket
- example: a company reaches an agreement with a satellite imagery provider to take satellite photos of a specific region -> use AWS ground station to communicate with that company's satellite and download image data to S3 bucket

AWS Outpost: rack of servers running AWS infrastructure on your physical location 
- U: rack unit -> standard rack size: 47U
- comes in 3 form factors: 42U, 1U, and 2U:
	+ 42U: full rack of servers -> delivered fully assembled and ready to be rolled into final position
	+ 1U and 2U: servers that can place into your existing rack
