- DB and web server sharing data, running in the same VPC: ipv4 -> public subnet (EC2 with web app and own security group) -> private subnet (RDS DB instance with own security group)
1. Create a VPC with private and public subnets:
- Create a VPC and subnets
- need an Elastic IP address to associate with a network address translation (NAT) gateway
- the elsatic IPs should be in the same region where you want to create your VPC
- Note the allocation ID of the new Elastic IP address as you'll need this info when you create your VPC
e.g.: eipalloc-042c284a6da4bbd91
- must have either 2 private subnets or 2 public subnets to create a DB subnet group for a DB instance to use in a VPC. Beacuase DB is private -> add a 2nd private subnet to the VPC
2. Create a VPC security group for a public web server:
- security group for public access -> add inbound rules to your VPC security group that allow traffic to connect from the internet -> note the security group id
e.g.: sg-03f7664a60a8b8d04
3. Create a VPC security group for a private DB instance:
- only for private access -> allow inbound traffic from web server only
4. Create a DB subnet group: a collection of subnets that you create in a VPC and then designate for your DB instances
5. Create your RDS Database -> note the endpoint and port to connect your web server to your DB instance
e.g.: data-utility.clg1vdbfdxex.ap-northeast-1.rds.amazonaws.com ; 5432
6. Launch a "public" EC2 instance (configured to be SSH accessible from your IP only) -> note instance ID
e.g.: i-01cc11b8edd0c0c57
with the key.pem -> need to set the permissions of your private key file so that only you can read it:
chmod 400 my-key-pair.pem
7. SSH to your instance:
- need instance ID: i-01cc11b8edd0c0c57
- need public DNS name: ec2-54-250-171-216.ap-northeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com
- username: either your user account or default user name for the AMI e.g. Amazon Linux AMI:ec2-user; Ubuntu AMI: ubuntu
ssh -i /path/my-key-pair.pem my-instance-user-name@my-instance-public-dns-name
Transfer file:
scp -i /path/my-key-pair.pem /path/transfer-file user-name@public-dns-name:path/
 
8. CONNECT through DBEAVER:
- SSH:
ssh -N -i ec2_key_pair_name.pem -L 5000:database_endpoint.com:database_port_number ec2-user@ec2_public_ipv4
- Open DBeaver:
	- Host: localhost, Port: 5000

9. CONNECT through Python:
from sshtunnel import SSHTunnelForwarder as SSHTF

with SSHTF((ec2-public-DNS), ssh_username="ec2-user", ssh-pkey="", remote_bind_address(RDS-private-link, RDS-port) as tunnel:
	* do something with the database e.g. connection established
